GENERAL NOTES:
DLM-DAM interaction
 - DLM must be able to handle a CAN command that passes in Parameter and Bucket, what DAM can be obtained by what module sent it. (this will need to be added to GopherCAN)
   ex: add_param_to_bucket(U8 sending_dam, U16 param_id, U8 bucket_id)
       assign_bucket_to_frq(U8 sending_dam, U8 bucket_id, U8 frq_id)


TODOs:
general:
 - Spend time cleaning include paths

manage_data_aquisition:
 - Consider and implement what to do in case of malloc errors
 - TX_CAN_MESSAGE errors (full buffers)

TESTS:
manage_data_aquisition:
 [_] TEST adding and removing parameters from buckets. This will also test the linked lists
 [_] TEST assigning bucket frequencies
 [_] TEST time-based bucket requests
 [_] TEST if double pointer witchcraft is done correctly in init()

move_ram_data_to_storage:


NOTES:
manage_data_aquisition:
 - maximum time between bucket requests = ~60 seconds
 - Possible bug if a data message takes too long to return and another bucket request is already sent before it is recieved
