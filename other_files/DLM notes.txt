GENERAL NOTES:
DLM-DAM interaction
 - DLM must be able to handle a CAN command that passes in Parameter and Bucket, what DAM can be obtained by what module sent it. (this will need to be added to GopherCAN)
   ex: add_param_to_bucket(U8 sending_dam, U16 param_id, U8 bucket_id)
       assign_bucket_to_frq(U8 sending_dam, U8 bucket_id, U8 frq_id)


TODOs:
general:
 - Spend time cleaning include paths
 - Handle malloc errors better

manage_data_aquisition:
 - Consider and implement what to do in case of malloc errors
 - TX_CAN_MESSAGE errors (full buffers)

move_ram_data_to_storage:


TESTS:
manage_data_aquisition:
 [x] TEST adding and parameters from buckets. This will also test the linked lists
 [x] TEST assigning bucket frequencies
 [x] TEST time-based bucket requests
 [x] TEST if double pointer witchcraft is done correctly in init()
 [x] TEST adding every data point to storage
 [_] TEST parameters with IDs greater than 255
 [_] TEST bucket request intervals greater than 255

move_ram_data_to_storage:
 [x] TEST memory usage
 [x] TEST for memory leaks by running for a very long time with lots of data aquisition
 [x] TEST data string builder to make sure it does everything correctly - check casting for each data type
 [_] TEST what happends with a full SD card


NOTES:
manage_data_aquisition:
 - maximum time between bucket requests = ~65 seconds
 - Possible bug if a data message takes too long to return and another bucket request is already sent before it is recieved

move_ram_data_to_storage:
 - All data is stored as a dpf in the USB storage, https://blog.demofox.org/2017/11/21/floating-point-precision/ has a good table showing the precision of this storage method
    For integers, +/-2^53 can be stored
 - This causes each data point to be 14B, and if 1000 data points are collected per second this takes ~840kB per minute
 - There is a hang if the SD card is removed without being unmounted, but it is resolved after the FATfs timeout
 - Did not work with a SDHC card (gives DISK_ERR), but 2GB should be plenty for a drive day
 - File name must be a .txt
